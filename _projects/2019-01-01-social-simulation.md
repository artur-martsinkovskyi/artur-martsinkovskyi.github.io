# Summary

Social simulation project with desktop representation via 2d game gem Gosu and plain Ruby. Most of the initial things are generated with PCG methods(noises FoN algorithms, random distributions, e.t.c). Has a stepping engine with ability to go back and replay various steps. Is planned to have more reports, analytics and advanced actor interaction system. Supports limited concurrency, partially covered with tests, I still try to figure out the format of integration testing for such a projects Is planned to have more reports, analytics and advanced actor interaction system.
