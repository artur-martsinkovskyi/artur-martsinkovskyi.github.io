People are not good at predicting future. Gosh, even thinking about the future realistically varies from pretty hard to impossible.Future is a slice of an entangled mess of reasons and consequences that create a huge and highly intertwiened system, so no wonder our little biological computers are bad at simulation of it. We may dream about the future, we may create approximate vision of what is going to happen, but we never know exactly. Looking furher in the future it becomes harder and harder to see even the unfocused blurry vision of what is going to happen. So people do the best they can - they rely on the old mechanisms the nature has built into us long time ago - intuition, aspiration, Gestalt of the future if you wish. This vision is highly material, it relies on what they see and feel rather than what they reason about. They see the future as a continuation of the present, so their mind cuts the corners on unknown or uncertain things focusing on what it deems important - actual factual data it manages to retrieve from the surrounding world.
