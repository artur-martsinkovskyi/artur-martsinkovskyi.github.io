Here is a little ironic reflection on the 12 principle of Agile Manifesto.

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

In most cases, the highest priority is to get as much money from the customer as possible with least work thanks to a big mouth sales manager, submissive project manager and coders who know how to kick the bucket of refactoring long down the road.

> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

Almost any software engineer moans and yells when requirements change, because world should be static enough to fit in his mindwork, but not static enough to let him go and stop getting paid for his creation.

> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

Sprint a week is nice, do you agree, fellow developer? *winks uncontrollably*

> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

It is an amusment and great pleasure to get an answer from BA less than 3 days after the request, most time they are very busy with making your life harder. On the other hand, developers don't really want to get along
with those humanitarian degree peasants that don't embrace the greatness of another Javascript framework and are not hip at all, business does not give a damn about developers and requires working funcionality here and
now(they have not yet decided actual body of work for it, but you gotta do something).

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

Motivated individuals are great people with hiring ratio for your company close to zero. Most of the people work to get fed and covered, not to bring value to somebody elses business. Unforunately,
real world breaks the bright visions of future when methodoly for focused self-controlled motivated professionals is applied to procrastinating incontinent discouraged amauters.

> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

Outsourcing reality: your manager is the only in/out source of data to the customer which leads to unforunate data corruption on the way. Your teammates are not willing to do anything but code and drink coffee, so face-to-face conversations turn into interrogations with an enemy spy rather than friendly convos.

> Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Translation from your manager: don't give a heck about legacy and technical debt the size of US national debt until the system starts breaking like a heart of 90 years old coffee maniac. When it does - rush to fix it, but not too long, you are not paid for fixing stuff.

> Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

That is the development pace - you break and rot the project until every new feature implementation process feels like Indiana Jones movie tomb walk, then customer sets you up one sprint for refactoring and fixing the techdebt. After a few hours of fixing customer is confused that project is still not elegantly ideal.

> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Code up and break things, production will signal all the bugs, leave "technical excellence" at the university, we are in the real world of development, where there is only blood, iron and bits... What? Our test suite runs for hours and some components are 3000 lines long? Come on, we bring the value, there is no need to worry.

> Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

Customer knows best what to do, yep, we had a lot of situations where requirements changed mid-sprint or right after it, even though everyone was digging hard to release the feature noone needs as a result. This is simple - you are paid to code, not to argue.

> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

And his left hand did not know what the right did, so they was self-organized as swan, pike and a crab.

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

It is hard to reflect when your manager thinks effectivity depends on the amount of hours you spend at the office.
