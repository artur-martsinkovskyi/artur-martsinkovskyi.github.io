One of the most clickbaity talks I've ever had.

Ruby is a language that exploded in the mid 10-th of current century and now entered the plateau of maturity. Will it be here for another decade? Will it die off? Is it dead already?

It was presented on [It Rally Pegasus](https://www.facebook.com/events/205836950002968/permalink/212498429336820/).
