I am a Software Engineer on Ruby and some other languages, Vim enthusiast and a big fan of FP, XP, and TDD(and a couple of other abbreviations also, like TANSTAAFL). I have Computer Science Master's degree in the Precarpathian National University. Rationalist with a sprinkle of sci-fi aspirations. Interested in medical, financial, logistic and civil engineering domains. Proud Thinkpad user, use Mac Mini at work, get along with Windows as with necessary evil time to time. Also, I am keen on space, rockets, and imagery of the gold era of hard sci-fi, Bradbury and Heinlein and their kind. The name of this blog is taken from Bowie's song "Life on Mars?" with a slight change to my actual surname in short.

DISCLAIMER: Some of the posts in this blog look like quite the furious rants(and they are). Although, I write on painful topics only in the time of the biggest emotional embarrassment about them, so actual me out in the wild may have a bit milder opinions when you ask me in person. I always thought that it is better to go full radical on some topics for people around to stop halfway and still have my post influence their actions enough.
