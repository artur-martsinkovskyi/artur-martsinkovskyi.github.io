<a href="https://github.com/artur-martsinkovskyi"><b>Artur Martsinkovskyi</b></a>, engineer, public speaker, poet, blogger, weirdo.

I am a Software Engineer on Ruby and some other languages, Vim enthusiast and a big fan of FP, XP and TDD(and a couple of other abbreviations also, like TNSTAAFL). I am a Computer Science graduate student in the Precarpathian National University. Rationalist with a sprinkle of sci-fi aspirations. Interested in medical, financial, logistic and civil engineering domains. Proud Thinkpad user, use Mac Mini at work, get along with Windows as with neccessary evil time to time. Also I am keen on space, rockets and imagery of the gold era of hard sci-fi, Bradbury and Heinlein and their kind. The name of this blog is taken from Bowie song "Life on Mars?" with a slight change to my actual surname in short.

DISCLAIMER: Some of the posts in this blog look like quite the furious rants(and they are). Although, I write on a painful topics only in the time of the biggest emotional embarassement about them, so actual me out in the wild may have a bit midler opinions when you ask me in person. I always thought that it is better to go full radical on some topics for people around to stop halfway and still have my post influence their actions enough.
